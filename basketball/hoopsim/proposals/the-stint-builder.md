# The Stint Builder

## Creating Players

The only change within the player builder is the removal of **archetypes & traits**; these have been replaced by **primary/secondary attributes & badges**.

##  How It Works

This system **encourages freedom within the builder** while also trying to **keep the league clean, and fair.** You can make the **unique builds** you want without feeling like they aren't up-to-par with normal-meta builds. And because the level of customization is so in-depth and unique to each player, metas will be hard to come by.

Enough reading though; here's the system.

## Weights/Values

The **'16 points available'** is just a placeholder. We'll work to make the number of points available in the builder as fair as possible. The weights (cost of each attribute/badge) are also subject to change and we'll make sure they make sense. 

When you're creating a new player you can choose multiple attributes and badges as long as you don't go over the **points available.** *Why are attributes and badges weighted?* Simply put, some badges and attributes are more valuable than others.

Basically, each attribute and badge has it's own **'cost'** or **'value'** in the player builder.

## Spent Rewards
-   $10,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +1 secondary point) **(badge split: 12/18)**
-   $20,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +1 primary point, +1 secondary points) **(badge split: 13/20)**
-   $30,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +1 primary point, +3 secondary points) **(badge split: 14/23)**
-   $40,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +2 primary points, +2 secondary points) **(badge split: 16/25)**
-   $50,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +2 primary points, +2 secondary points) **(badge split: 18/27)**
-   $60,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +2 primary points, +2 secondary points) **(badge split: 20/29)**
-   $80,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +2 primary points, +3 secondary points) **(badge split: 22/32)**
-   $100,000 (+1 badge upgrade, +2 primary points, +4 secondary points) **(badge split: 24/36)**
  
*(Players who invest in a base badge before adding it as a primary or secondary can refund the difference in price)*

These rewards give **(even new players)** something to look forward to throughout their careers.

## What about my existing player!?
- *You'll be refunded:* **amount you have spent + amount in your player's bank account**
- Your **attributes & badges will then be reset and you can re-upgrade your player** within the new system.
- There will be a page for existing players to choose their primary/secondary attributes & badges within the new system **(no need for a ticket)**.

## Conclusion
The reason I'm pushing for this system so blatantly is because it allows you to have true freedom in the builder without hurting the health of the league. We can make unique builds without suffering the consequence you would in the current builder.
